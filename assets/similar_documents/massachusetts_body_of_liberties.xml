Lev. 20:15, 16.\n\n\t8.   If any man lies with mankind as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed abomination, they both shall surely be put to death. Lev. 20:13.\n\n\t9.   If any person commits Adultery with a married or espoused wife, the Adulterer and Adulteress shall surely be put to death.\n\n\t10.   If any man steals a man or mankind, he shall surely be put to death.\n\n\t11.   If any man rise up by false witness, wittingly and of purpose to take away any man\'s life, he shall be put to death.\n\n\t12.   If any man shall conspire and attempt any invasion, insurrection, or public rebellion against our commonwealth, or shall endeavor to surprise any Town or Towns, fort or forts therein, or shall treacherously and perfidiously attempt the alteration and subversion of our frame of polity or Government fundamentally, he shall be put to death.\n\n95.     A Declaration of the Liberties the Lord Jesus hath given to the Churches.\n\n\t1.   All the people of god within this Jurisdiction who are not in a church way, and be orthodox in Judgment, and not scandalous in life, shall have full liberty to gather themselves into a Church Estate. Provided they do it in a Christian way, with due observation of the rules of Christ revealed in his word.\n\n\t2.   Every Church has full liberty to exercise all the ordinances of god, according to the rules of scripture.\n\n\t3.   Every Church has free liberty of Election and ordination of all their officers from time to time, provided they be able, pious and orthodox.\n\n\t4.   Every Church has free liberty of Admission, Recommendation, Dismissal, and Expulsion, or deposal of their officers and members, upon due cause, with free exercise of the Discipline and Censures of Christ according to the rules of his word.\n\n\t5.   No Injunctions are to be put upon any Church, Church officers or member in point of Doctrine, worship or Discipline, whether for substance or circumstance besides the Institutions of the lord.\n\n\t6.   Every Church of Christ hath freedom to celebrate days of fasting and prayer, and of thanksgiving according to the word of god.\n\n\t7.   The Elders of Churches have free liberty to meet monthly, Quarterly, or otherwise, in convenient numbers and places, for conferences and consultations about Christian and Church questions and occasions.\n\n\t8.   All Churches have liberty to deal with any of their members in a church way that are in the hand of Justice. So it be not to retard or hinder the course thereof.\n\n\t9.   Every Church has liberty to deal with any magistrate, Deputy of Court or other officer whatsoever that is a member in a church way in case of apparent and just offence given in their places, so it be done with due observance and respect.\n\n\t10.   We allow private meetings for edification in religion among Christians of all sorts of people. So it be without just offense for number, time, place, and other circumstances.\n\n\t11.   For the preventing and removing of error and offense that may grow and spread in any of the Churches in this Jurisdiction, and for the preserving of truth and peace in the several churches within themselves, and for the maintenance and exercise of brotherly communion, among all the churches in the Country, It is allowed and ratified, by the Authority of this General Court as a lawful liberty of the Churches of Christ. That once in every month of the year (when the season will bear it) It shall be lawful for the ministers and Elders, of the Churches near adjoining together, with any other of the brethren with the consent of the churches to assemble by course in each several Church one after an other. To the intent after the preaching of the word by such a minister as shall be requested thereto by the Elders of the church where the Assembly is held, The rest of the day may be spent in public Christian Conference about the discussing and resolving of any such doubts and cases of conscience concerning matter of doctrine or worship or government of the church as shall be propounded by any of the Brethren of that church, with leave also to any other Brother to propound his objections or answers for further satisfaction according to the word of god. Provided that the whole action be guided and moderated by the Elders of the Church where the Assembly is held, or by such others as they shall appoint. And that no thing be concluded and imposed by way of Authority from one or more Churches upon an other, but only by way of Brotherly conference and consultations. That the truth may be searched out to the satisfying of every mans conscience in the sight of god according to his word. And because such an Assembly and the work thereof can not be duly attended to if other lectures be held in the same week. It is therefore agreed with the consent of the Churches. That in that week when such an Assembly is held, All the lectures in all the neighboring Churches for that week shall be forborne. That so the public service of Christ in this more solemn Assembly may be transacted with greater diligence and attention.\n\n96.     Howsoever these above specified rites, freedoms, Immunities, Authorities and privileges, both Civil and Ecclesiastical are expressed only under the name and title of Liberties, and not in the exact form of Laws or Statutes, yet we do with one consent fully Authorize, and earnestly entreat all that are and shall be in Authority to consider them as laws, and not to fail to inflict condign and proportionable punishments upon every man impartially, that shall infringe or violate any of them.\n\n97.     We likewise give full power and liberty to any person that shall at any time be denied or deprived of any of them, to commence and prosecute their suit, Complaint or action against any man that shall so do in any Court that has proper Cognizance or judicature thereof.\n\n98.     Lastly because our duty and desire is to do nothing suddenly which fundamentally concern us, we decree that these rites and liberties, shall be Audibly read and deliberately weighed at every General Court that shall be held, within three years next ensuing. And such of them as shall not be altered or repealed they shall stand so ratified, That no man shall infringe them without due punishment.\n\nAnd if any General Court within these next three years shall fail or forget to read and consider them as above said. The Governor and Deputy Governor for the time being, and every Assistant present at such Courts shall forfeit 20 sh. a man, and every Deputy 10 sh. a man for each neglect, which shall be paid out of their proper estate, and not by the Country or the Towns which choose them, and whensoever there shall arise any question in any Court among the Assistants and Associates thereof about the explanation of these Rites and liberties, The General Court only shall have power to interpret them.\n\n</item>
